## Steps to Complete the Project 
First task was very easy
Second one: I could not read from gcs bucket directly into spark dataframe. 
            Tried 2 hours and then gave up. Know that I could have made it different. 
            But could not believe that I'm not able to do this part that should not be so complicately

So next step would be to understand pyspark with gcs better
